# Transport Data Optimization and Insights
## Objective
This project aims to optimize public transportation routes and extract insights from a detailed dataset using Excel, SQL, Python, and Power BI. The goal is to enhance efficiency, identify bottlenecks, and improve service delivery.

## How to Install and Run
* Prerequisites
Ensure Python is installed with Pandas and Matplotlib libraries (pip install pandas matplotlib).
Access to a database system for running SQL scripts.
* Installation Steps
Install Python dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Set up your database environment and import the dataset.
## How to Use
* Excel Dashboard: Open Excel_Dashboard.xlsx to explore visual summaries and use filters for detailed views.
* SQL Analysis: Execute SQL_Analysis.sql in your database to analyze data and find peak periods.
* Python Scripts: Use TransportDataAnalyzer.py for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
* Power BI Dashboard: Access PowerBI_TransportDashboard.pbix for dynamic insights and trends.
## skills Utilized
